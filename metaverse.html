<h1 >What is Metaverse?</h1>
<p1 style="font-size:150%">To help you get a sense of how vague the term “the metaverse” can be, here's an exercise: Mentally replace the phrase “the metaverse” in a sentence with “cyberspace.” Ninety percent of the time, the meaning won't substantially change. That's because the term doesn't really refer to any one specific type of technology, but rather a broad (and often speculative) shift in how we interact with technology. And it's entirely possible that the term itself will eventually become just as antiquated, even as the specific technology it once described becomes commonplace.

<h2 style="font-family:sans-serif; color:#483D8B;">Why Does the Metaverse Involve Holograms?</h2>
<p2 style="font-family:Monospace; font-size:150%">When the internet first arrived, it started with a series of technological innovations, like the ability to let computers talk to each other over great distances or the ability to hyperlink from one web page to another. These technical features were the building blocks that were then used to make the abstract structures we know the internet for: websites, apps, social networks, and everything else that relies on those core elements. And that's to say nothing of the convergence of the interface innovations that aren't strictly part of the internet but are still necessary to make it work, such as displays, keyboards, mice, and touchscreens.

<h3 style="font-family:Monaco; color:#8E44AD; font-size:200%">The Future Of Metaverse</h3>
<p3 style="font-family:Monospace; font-size:150%">Say goodbye to your traditional workspace. You will likely be surrounded by surfaces that provide new interfaces and a new realm of instantaneous virtual connections to people, places and work settings. Modern tools will let you forge connections and manipulate 3D objects intuitively within the lifelike virtual space you are occupying.<br>

By 2030, we can expect to see the emergence of brain computer interfaces (BCIs) that enable human thought to be tracked, recorded and shared. These XR capabilities may literally enable us to experience moments and memories from someone else’s life. Synthetic data generated from simulated worlds, meanwhile, will likely guide robots to problem solve and replace humans performing high-risk work.<br><br>In the coming decade, higher education and job training may increasingly be provided in virtual 3D settings, along with boardroom and workplace meetings. Businesses and governments will rely on the power and reach of the metaverse to share information, provide services and collaborate as never before.

<h4 style="font-size:200%; color:#7D3C98">What happens to privacy in the metaverse?
</h4>
<p4 style="font-family:Monospace; font-size:150%">With hundreds of millions of virtual reality products expected to be in use in the next 5 years, experts believe it will not be unusual for people to spend 12 to 15 hours a day in the metaverse to communicate, work, learn, shop, capture data and more. It is also expected that people will have more than one avatar, or virtual persona, which may create a reality of billions of digital personas within a decade. But as usage explodes, what are the risks to privacy and identity security?

Regulators and governments will need to invest in wide-scale deployment and testing of the emerging technology ensure appropriate security and privacy protection. <br><br><br>

Appropriate data management in the metaverse will need to address, for example, the differences between traditional business or public data and confidential personal data. </p4>
